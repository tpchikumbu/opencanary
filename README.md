# opencanary
FreeBSD port for OpenCanary

## Overview
OpenCanary is a network honeypot used to detect hackers on a compromised system. This project allows OpenCanary to be downloaded straight from the FreeBSD ports tree. OpenCanary uses some python modules which do not currently have FreeBSD ports. They can however be downloaded using the pip installer. The required modules without ports are:

- hpfeeds
- ntlmlib
